# ⚠️No time to develop this anymore. Plus maybe it was not a good idea, there are better ways to share knowledge.⚠️
Simple blog website to host my OSM related stuff like my validation workflow, validator checker and possible future projects. 

This project was created because I got annoyed by the limitations of kramdown in OSM Diary. The website is available as https://patrik-br.github.io/blog/

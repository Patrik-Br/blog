        <h3>Validating multiple tasks at once or “Multivalidation”</h3>

        <p>When you are reading this you should be already experienced with validating and using JOSM so I will not include basics here.</p>
        
        <p>Usually I am validating projects in HOT Tasking Manager that are focused on mapping buildings. I am going to show you an example of my workflow on one of the Mozambique projects because there are two things that are not in every project and it’s very easy to validate in this area so you can try it on your own. Since writing this diary the campaign ended but you can find similar projects using <a href="https://tasks.hotosm.org/explore?difficulty=EASY&exactTypes=1&omitMapResults=1&organisation=M%C3%A9decins%20Sans%20Fronti%C3%A8res%20%28MSF%29%20&types=BUILDINGS">this filter on the HOT Tasking Manager</a>.</p>

        <p>I highly recommend using the shortcuts in JOSM, which you can customize, or you can put tools that you are often using to your toolbar. I will write shortcuts for windows in <code>{}</code>.</p>

        <h2>For Multivalidation in Mozambique I am using these tools:</h2>

        <details>
            <summary>EXPERT MODE</summary>
            <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zMk4e-GiKih7q_Z47Tl6S_JYG_dEu8_9/view?usp=sharing">Edit → Preferences {F12} → checkbox in the bottom left corner</a>. Thanks to this you will be able to see some stuff that has been hidden before like the number of each layer, more options for Search or some tools like extrude tool for example. If you are using shortcuts (like {X} for extrude tool) those will work even if you won’t turn on the Expert mode.</p>

        <details>
            <summary>PLUGINS</summary>
            <p>List of plugins that I am using and their most useful feature for me:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Buildings_tools - fundamental plugin for mapping buildings</li>
                <li>Todo - great tool for adding buildings, task areas, anything into list and then easily check all of them one by one</li>
                <li>Utilsplugin2 - mainly for Replace geometry {Ctrl+Shift+G}</li>
                <li>Mapathoner - mainly for Selecting non orthogonal buildings</li>
                <li>Markseen - mark seen areas of the map</li>
            </ul>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>VALIDATOR RESULTS PANEL</summary>
            <p>I am using additional custom rules that are flagging some uncommon mistakes made by other mappers. The name is "Validating tasks in HOT TM projects". <a href="https://bit.ly/3zzivTi" target="_blank">Here is their full description with guide how to add them into JOSM</a>.</p>
        </details>
        
        <h2>Taskgrid</h2>
        <p>Importing borders of every task (taskgrid) in the project:</p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19DuJRtug2F67S5nh2ytmcZSbN20d9ttJ/view?usp=sharing">
                File › Open Location {Ctrl+L}
            </a>.
        </p>
        <p>Use the following URL format:</p>
        <pre>https://tasking-manager-tm4-production-api.hotosm.org/api/v2/projects/PROJECT_ID/tasks/?as_file=true&format=geojson</pre>
        <p>For example, for project #12658:</p>
        <pre>https://tasking-manager-tm4-production-api.hotosm.org/api/v2/projects/12658/tasks/?as_file=true&format=geojson</pre>
        <p>
            <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19DuJRtug2F67S5nh2ytmcZSbN20d9ttJ/view?usp=sharing">
                Make sure to tick the option "Download as new layer."
            </a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Don’t worry about memorizing the URL—JOSM will remember it, and you’ll only need to edit the <code>PROJECT_ID</code> part.
        </p>
        <p>
            I import the taskgrid because, in this project, we are supposed to map buildings outside the task boundary. Since we don’t want to map buildings inside other tasks, the taskgrid helps us determine whether they are inside or not.
        </p>

        <h2>Map Paint Styles</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_zm3HKzl1lutPXvBcVhCSfRqq2vhOgcm/view?usp=sharing">
                Map paint styles
            </a> are useful tools that can change how the map appears. I created a custom style for my preferences, and you can do the same using
            <a href="https://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/Help/Styles/MapCSSImplementation">MapCSS</a>.

            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Search</h2>
        <p>Edit › Search {Ctrl+F}. A very useful tool for validation. If you frequently use certain search strings, you can turn them into buttons on your toolbar:</p>
        <p>
            Tick the <code>Add toolbar button</code> option in the Search window. You can customize button icons via
            <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aF542OojOno5PS1paXl-tBvKnap_j49E/view?usp=sharing">Edit › Preferences {F12} › Toolbar</a> or
            <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CfLRwbBKvN21Wwxib6VIrH9A0MikskSJ/view?usp=sharing">Configure Toolbar</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Some recommended search strings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>building:-yes</code>: Select all buildings without <code>building=yes</code>.</li>
            <li><code>building=yes nodes:5-20</code>: Select buildings with 5–20 nodes (useful for catching circular buildings).</li>
            <li><code>type:way</code>: Select task borders being validated.</li>
            <li>
                <code>area[building] > node:connection</code>:
                <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15UPX1UUFQAL1M7T6P6JIf7z8BXLKOGkt/view?usp=sharing">
                    Use MapCSS selector in the search panel
                </a>. Highlights shared nodes for easier selection.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Workflow</h2>
        <p>
            In Tasking Manager, I select multiple tasks (filtered by user for better feedback). After locking tasks, I check for mapper comments or questions.
        </p>
        <p>Steps in JOSM:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Import the taskgrid (<code>File › Open Location</code>).</li>
            <li>Run validation searches and add flagged results to the Todo list.</li>
            <li>Check task boundaries and surrounding areas for unmapped buildings.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            After validating all tasks, I leave feedback, pointing out mistakes with examples or screenshots. Comments should be clear and concise, with references to specific tasks if needed.
